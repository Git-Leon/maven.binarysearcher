# Package Overview
### Things to Remember
* (S)TSU
    * (Solution) - Runs test
    * Test - Demonstrates how a problem can be resolved via proposed function
    * Solver - Is algorithmic proof of the underlying procedure to make test succeed
    * Utilities - additional `private` functions that may need to be defined for `Solver` algorithm to exist
